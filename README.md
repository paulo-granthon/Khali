<summary> SPRINT 2 - Creation of the Evaluation System</summary>
 
  | USER STORY | PRIORITY |
  |------------|------------|
  | As the Group Leader, I will evaluate the Technical Leaders of my group according to the functional requirement | Essential |
  | As the Fake Client, I will evaluate the POs of my group according to the functional requirement | Essential |
  | As the PO, I will evaluate the Technical Leader, students of my team, and myself according to the functional requirement | Essential |
  | As a student, I will evaluate all other members of my team and myself according to the functional requirement | Essential |
  
  ### Dashboard with members to be evaluated by the user in the current Sprint, before the evaluation period
  * In the example, the Fake Client Instructor evaluates only the Product Owner Students
  ![Evaluation - Fake Client](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111442399/204164568-c7e5e47b-5026-40c1-a321-c5e8c18c6072.gif)
  
  ### Dashboard with members to be and already evaluated by the user in the current Sprint, during the evaluation period, and the Evaluation System
  * In the example, the Developer Student needs to evaluate all members of his team and himself (self-assessment)
  * Grades equal to or lower than 3 require a descriptive response (feedback). The evaluation cannot be submitted without filling in this field

  ### Dashboard with members already evaluated and to be evaluated by the user in the current Sprint, during the evaluation period
  * In the example, the Technical Leader Student needs to evaluate all members of his team and himself (self-assessment). He had already filled in some evaluations, and the respective members are in different lists, evaluated and not evaluated. A chart shows the progress of the completion.

<summary> SPRINT 3 - Creation of the Dashboard System</summary>
	

| USER STORY | PRIORITY |
|------------|------------|
| As a student, I want to have access to a dashboard that presents my individual results in the evaluations, so that I can monitor and analyze my performance in relation to the evaluations performed by me and by other members of my Team | Important |
| As the Group Leader, I want to have access to a dashboard with the results of my teams in the evaluations, so that I can monitor and analyze them | Important |
| As the Group Leader, I want to have access to a dashboard with the results of

 the evaluations of the Technical Leaders, Product Owners, and Fake Clients, so that I can monitor and analyze them | Important |

  ### Dashboard showing individual results
  * In the example, the dashboard is from a Group Leader. The student can access their individual dashboard through the Student login with the same information (similar structure and information, with the exception of additional information such as the list of teams to which the student belongs, average by Sprint, progress graphs, among others)

  ### Dashboard with Group results
  * In the example, the dashboard is from a student who is a Group Leader. The student can access their Team's dashboard through the Student login with the same information (similar structure and information, with the exception of additional information such as the average of each member of the team by Sprint, progress graphs, among others)
